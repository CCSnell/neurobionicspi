**Robot CI**: Effortless building, testing, and deploying customized robot operating systems at scale. This tool lets you **version control your entire robot OS configuration and makes remote development a breeze**.

## üéØ Key Features

This tool solves common challenges in robotics development:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Version-Controlled OS** | Track and manage your robot environment in code, enabling reproducible builds with GitHub Actions, and allowing for easy rollbacks and collaboration. |
| **Remote Development** | Provides optimized headless server images with automatic IP notifications via email, facilitating seamless remote development. |
| **Customizable Environment** | Allows for the pre-installation of drivers and custom packages, and the configuration of services and boot sequences to tailor the environment to specific needs. |
| **Network Auto-Config** | Automatically connects to WiFi networks and establishes a fallback access point when no WiFi networks are available, ensuring continuous connectivity. |

## üë• Ideal for Developers Who
- Want to **streamline the RPi setup process** for students, teams, interns, etc.
- Desire a **version-controlled robot environment**.
- Require **reproducible** development setups.
- Prefer **remote development** over manual RPi configuration.
- **Manage multiple robots** with similar configurations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Use Cases
- **Research labs** managing multiple test platforms or robots
- Robotics companies **deploying a fleet of robots**
- Educational institutions maintaining **student robots for course projects**
- Development teams needing **consistent robot environments** across multiple robots

> [!NOTE]
> Currently tested on Raspberry Pi 4 and 5. May not be compatible with Raspberry Pi Zero.

## Getting Started
If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, we recommend their tutorials available on [GitHub's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GitHub)

### 1. Repository Setup
You have two options to use this repository:

1. **Fork the Repository** (Recommended)
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top of this repository
   - Maintains connection to the original repository
   - Useful if you want to receive future updates and contribute back

2. **Use as a Template**
   - Click the green "Use this template" button at the top of this repository
   - This creates a new repository with a clean history
   - Best for starting your own customized version

Choose the option that best suits your needs:
- Choose **Fork** if you want to stay updated with the original repository's changes
- Choose **Template** if you want a clean slate for your own project

### 2. Secrets Setup

The next step is to create the secrets that securely handle sensitive information. These secrets will be added to the image configuration when running the workflow. To add secrets, navigate to the Settings tab, and select **Secrets and variables**, and select Actions. Create each of the following secrets, making sure to use the same variable naming:

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `EMAIL_ADDRESS` | Email address(es) to send notifications to; separate multiple addresses with commas **("," and not ", ")** |
| `ENTNETWORK_SSID` | Enterprise (e.g. university) wifi network name |
| `ENTNETWORK_IDENTITY` | Network username |
| `ENTNETWORK_PASSWORD` | Network password |
| `ENTNETWORK_PRIORITY` | Choose connection priority (e.g. a number greater than five will be higher priority; higher is greater priority) |
| `SMTP_SERVER` | SMTP server for email notifications, for Gmail use `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_USERNAME` | Username for the email account that will send notifications |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Password for the email account that will send notifications |
| `WIFI_COUNTRY_CODE` | WiFi country code, defaults to US if not set |

Optional secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `TIMEZONE` | Timezone for the device, defaults to America/New_York if not set |
| `KEYBOARD_LAYOUT` | Keyboard layout, defaults to us if not set |
| `KEYBOARD_MODEL` | Keyboard model, defaults to pc105 if not set |

#### Optional: Configuring SMTP
To send email notifications, you can configure a Gmail account to work with SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). This is easiest with a personal Gmail account, because certain organization or university accounts may have restrictions on creating an app password (a requirement for SMTP configuration).

> *Note: For non-Gmail accounts, more guidelines on SMTP configuration can be found [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en).*

1. Go to your [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2. Enable [2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) if it's not already turned on.
3. Generate an App Password:
   - In your Google Account Settings, go to `Security`, and click `App Passwords`. You can also navigate to your App Passwords by clicking [here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
   - Select **Mail** as the app.
   - Choose any name for the device.
   - Click **Generate**.
   - Copy the 16-character code (including the spaces).
4. Add the following values to your secret variables:
   - `SMTP_PASSWORD`: the App Password you just generated
   - `SMTP_USERNAME`: your full Gmail address (e.g. `[your-username]@gmail.com`)
   - `SMTP_SERVER`: `smtp.gmail.com`

### 3. Build Your Image
1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab, enable workflows by clicking on the green button, and then select **Build** from the left hand side
2. Click the **Run Workflow** button and select your build options:
   - Choose between `raspbian` (default) or `ubuntu`
      > *Note: ubuntu is NOT compatible with Raspberry Pi 4*
   - Provide your `admin password` and `user password`. Users are created based on the `EMAIL_ADDRESS` secret, for example, if `EMAIL_ADDRESS` secret is set to "user1@example.com,user2@example.com", two users will be created: "user1" and "user2" and the first user will be considered the admin and all other users will be considered regular users.
   - Configure WiFi settings for additional home networks
   - Be sure to record this information--you will need it (e.g. access point login info)
   - ‚òï Grab a cup of coffee. This process takes about ten minutes
3. Once the build is complete, click on the **build**, and the OS image will be available as an artifact in the Actions tab. It will be a .zip file available for download. 

### 4. Deploy & Connect
1. Download and flash the image to an SD card using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
   - Select your RPi hardware version number in the Raspberry Pi Imager
   - Choose the Operating System, scroll to the last option, and select **Use custom**
   - Browse to the custom image recently downloaded from your image build
   - Select the SD card as the storage medium
   - Select No to 'Apply OS customization options?' 
3. Boot your RPi. Please use a 15-25+ W power supply (e.g not a low-power PC USB port) to ensure proper RPi functionality
> [!NOTE]
> **First Boot**: After powering on your Raspberry Pi for the first time, wait 5 minutes and then power off and on again. This first boot will not send an email. Please power cycle after five minutes for the email and network services to be available. This is only required for the first boot.
3. Connect via:
   - Enterprise or Home network: Check your email for the IP address
   - Fallback Access-Point (AP) mode: Connect to RPi's network (IP: 10.0.0.200)

If you encounter connection issues, good troubleshooting steps include connecting a monitor and visualizing the boot sequence. 

## üåê Network Behavior

Network management is streamlined by [Robonet](https://github.com/neurobionics/robonet), our custom CLI tool designed to simplify network configuration and management.

Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

- **Primary Connection**: Automatically connects to prioritized WiFi networks.
- **Fallback Mode**: Establishes an access point with a static IP of `10.0.0.200` when no preferred networks are available. Keeping 
- **IP Notification**: Sends an email notification with the device's IP address upon successful connection.

Read more about Robonet [here](https://github.com/neurobionics/robonet).

## Additional Configuration

1. Edit the `motd` file to customize the message of the day. This is displayed when the user logs in.
2. Edit the `packages.Pifile` file to install additional packages, services, and boot sequences.
3. Edit the `ssh.Pifile` file to configure SSH access for users.
4. Edit the `source.Pifile` file to build from a custom source that is not a default raspbian or ubuntu image.
