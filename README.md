</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Configure Secrets</summary>

The next step is to create the secrets that securely handle sensitive information. These secrets will be added to the image configuration when running the workflow. To add secrets, navigate to the Settings tab, and select **Secrets and variables**, and select Actions. Create each of the following secrets, making sure to use the same variable naming:

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `EMAIL_ADDRESS` | Email address(es) to send notifications to; separate multiple addresses with commas **("," and not ", ")** |
| `ENTNETWORK_SSID` | Enterprise (e.g. university) wifi network name |
| `ENTNETWORK_IDENTITY` | Network username |
| `ENTNETWORK_PASSWORD` | Network password |
| `ENTNETWORK_PRIORITY` | Choose connection priority (e.g. a number greater than five will be higher priority; higher is greater priority) |
| `SMTP_SERVER` | SMTP server for email notifications, for Gmail use `smtp.gmail.com` |
| `SMTP_USERNAME` | Username for the email account that will send notifications |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Password for the email account that will send notifications |
| `WIFI_COUNTRY_CODE` | WiFi country code, defaults to US if not set |

Optional secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `TIMEZONE` | Timezone for the device, defaults to America/New_York if not set |
| `KEYBOARD_LAYOUT` | Keyboard layout, defaults to us if not set |
| `KEYBOARD_MODEL` | Keyboard model, defaults to pc105 if not set |

#### Optional: Configuring SMTP
To send email notifications, you can configure a Gmail account to work with SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). This is easiest with a personal Gmail account, because certain organization or university accounts may have restrictions on creating an app password (a requirement for SMTP configuration).

> *Note: For non-Gmail accounts, more guidelines on SMTP configuration can be found [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en).*

1. Go to your [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2. Enable [2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop) if it's not already turned on.
3. Generate an App Password:
   - In your Google Account Settings, go to `Security`, and click `App Passwords`. You can also navigate to your App Passwords by clicking [here](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
   - Select **Mail** as the app.
   - Choose any name for the device.
   - Click **Generate**.
   - Copy the 16-character code (including the spaces).
4. Add the following values to your secret variables:
   - `SMTP_PASSWORD`: the App Password you just generated
   - `SMTP_USERNAME`: your full Gmail address (e.g. `[your-username]@gmail.com`)
   - `SMTP_SERVER`: `smtp.gmail.com`
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Build Your Image</summary>
1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab, enable workflows by clicking on the green button, and then select **Build** from the left hand side
2. Click the **Run Workflow** button and select your build options:
   - Choose between `raspbian` (default) or `ubuntu`
      > *Note: ubuntu is NOT compatible with Raspberry Pi 4*
   - Provide your `admin password` and `user password`. Users are created based on the `EMAIL_ADDRESS` secret, for example, if `EMAIL_ADDRESS` secret is set to "user1@example.com,user2@example.com", two users will be created: "user1" and "user2" and the first user will be considered the admin and all other users will be considered regular users.
   - Configure WiFi settings for additional home networks
   - Be sure to record this information--you will need it (e.g. access point login info)
   - ‚òï Grab a cup of coffee. This process takes about ten minutes
3. Once the build is complete, click on the **build**, and the OS image will be available as an artifact in the Actions tab. It will be a .zip file available for download. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Deploy & Connect</summary>
1. Download and flash the image to an SD card using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
   - Select your RPi hardware version number in the Raspberry Pi Imager
   - Choose the Operating System, scroll to the last option, and select **Use custom**
   - Browse to the custom image recently downloaded from your image build
   - Select the SD card as the storage medium
   - Select No to 'Apply OS customization options?' 
3. Boot your RPi. Please use a 15-25+ W power supply (e.g not a low-power PC USB port) to ensure proper RPi functionality

> [!NOTE]
> **First Boot**: After powering on your Raspberry Pi for the first time, wait 5 minutes and then power off and on again. This first boot will not send an email. Please power cycle after five minutes for the email and network services to be available. This is only required for the first boot.

3. Connect via:
   - Enterprise or Home network: Check your email for the IP address
   - Fallback Access-Point (AP) mode: Connect to RPi's network (IP: 10.0.0.200)

If you encounter any issues, please follow the debugging steps below. 
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Connect from Workstation to your Raspberry Pi</summary>
1. Download VS Code for your local machine. You can select the link below for your respective operating system and follow the tutorial: [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

2. Once VS Code is downloaded, open the application and navigate to the Extensions tab on the upper left side of the window. Click the Extensions icon on the sidebar (or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>). Once in the Extensions tab, search for ‚ÄúRemote Development‚Äù and install the ssh extension published by Microsoft.

3. Connect to Raspberry Pi via SSH in VS Code
   - Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (Windows) to open Command Palette.
   - Type and select <kbd>Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...</kbd>
   - Enter the SSH connection string: <kbd>ssh <user>@<IP Address></kbd>, where <kbd>IP</kbd> is the IP address of the raspberry pi you get via email notification or the local internet. <kbd>user</kbd> is the name previously configured when adding your email address
   - Enter the default Password when prompted.
   - After connecting, VS Code will prompt you to open a folder from your Pi. You can now edit files, run terminals, and develop just like local, but on your Raspberry Pi! 
</details>

## üêû Debugging

If you haven't received an IP address email within **10 minutes** of powering on your Raspberry Pi, follow these troubleshooting steps:

<details>
<summary>1. Check for Access Point Broadcast</summary>

- Your RPi should create an access point if it couldn't connect to known networks or send the IP email

- Look for the access point SSID you configured during setup in your available networks

- If you can connect to this access point, SSH into the RPi:

  ```
  ssh <username>@10.0.0.200
  ```

- If no access point is visible:
  - Connect a monitor and keyboard directly to your Raspberry Pi
  - Continue with the following diagnostic steps
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Verify Network Connection</summary>

Check your network interfaces with:

```
ifconfig
```

Look for:

- `eth#` for Ethernet connections
- `wlan#` for Wi-Fi connections

Note: `#` indicates the interface number (typically `wlan0` for the primary Wi-Fi interface)

A successful connection shows an IP address next to `wlan0`. If missing, your network configuration needs attention.
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Inspect Environment Variables</summary>

Environment variables control network, email, and SMTP server configuration:

```
cat /etc/environment
```

To modify any incorrect values:

```
sudo nano /etc/environment
```

Save changes with `Ctrl + O`, exit with `Ctrl + X`, then reboot:

```
sudo reboot
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Examine Network Configurations</summary>

Network connection files are stored in:

```
cd /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
```

View a specific network configuration:

```
sudo cat <network_SSID>.nmconnection
```

For enterprise networks, verify:
- `ssid` matches your target network
- `identity` contains the correct username
- `password` contains the correct credentials

For home networks, verify:
- `ssid` matches your home network name
- `psk` contains the correct password

To edit a configuration:

```
sudo nano <network_SSID>.nmconnection
```

After making changes, reboot your Raspberry Pi:

```
sudo reboot
```

If problems persist, please [open an issue](https://github.com/neurobionics/robot-ci/issues). Note that networking issues can be complex and specific to your environment, but we'll do our best to assist.

## üåê Network Behavior

Network management is streamlined by [Robonet](https://github.com/neurobionics/robonet), our custom CLI tool designed to simplify network configuration and management.

Here's a brief overview of its functionality:

- **Primary Connection**: Automatically connects to prioritized WiFi networks.
- **Fallback Mode**: Establishes an access point with a static IP of `10.0.0.200` when no preferred networks are available. Keeping 
- **IP Notification**: Sends an email notification with the device's IP address upon successful connection.

Read more about Robonet [here](https://github.com/neurobionics/robonet).

## Additional Configuration

1. Edit the `motd` file to customize the message of the day. This is displayed when the user logs in.
2. Edit the `packages.Pifile` file to install additional packages, services, and boot sequences.
3. Edit the `ssh.Pifile` file to configure SSH access for users.
4. Edit the `source.Pifile` file to build from a custom source that is not a default raspbian or ubuntu image.
